<!-- body-class:alt -->

Broken Access Control

---

Any situation where a user can access something that is outside their intended permissions

---

Manipulating URLs, cookies or tokens

---

Missing access controls on unexpected HTTP methods or routes

---

```
/api/getCustomerInformation?id=123129112
```

</div>

---

<!-- body-class:alt -->

Cryptographic Failures

---

Bad cryptography that can lead to unexpected data exposure

---

Weak SSL / TLS configurations that allow person in the middle attacks

<div class="footnote">
	Use Mozilla's <a href="https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/">SSL Config Generator</a> and Qualys' <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSL Labs Server Test</a>.
</div>

---

Missing HTTP Strict Transport Security headers that allow HTTP downgrade attacks

<div class="footnote">
	<a href="https://securityheaders.io">SecurityHeaders.io</a> has tests for this and a bunch of others.
</div>

---

The use of default passwords or secrets in applications

<div class="footnote">
	Default credentials are really <a href="https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet/blob/main/README.md">easy</a> <a href="https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet/blob/main/README.md">to</a> <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials">come</a> <a href="https://github.com/ztgrace/changeme/blob/master/README.md">by...</a>
</div>

---

Keys using weak algorithms or low entropy

Accidental key exposure

---

</div>


---

<!-- body-class:alt -->

Injection

---

Situations where user supplied data is directly injected into your code

---

Not just SQL!

LDAP, NoSQL, system commands, and ORMs are all targets.

---

<div>

</div>

---

<!-- body-class:alt -->

Insecure Design

---

Design and architectural flaws in your system

---

Promotes secure by design and ensures teams understand the security implications of changes

---

<div>
	<img src="https://media.brntn.me/postie/fee937f4.png" />
</div>

---

<!-- body-class:alt -->

Security Misconfiguration

---

Applications that are improperly secured because of a misconfiguration

---

Missed steps in go live or hardening documentation

---

Applications deployed to production with development configurations

---

Features enabled that aren't being used increasing the attack surface area

---

<div>
	<img src="https://media.brntn.me/postie/5f897134.png">
</div>

---

<!-- body-class:alt -->

Vulnerable and Outdated Components

---

Applications using components with known security vulnerabilities

---

Both accidental vulnerabilities and malicious changes apply here

---

Supply chain attacks

---

<div data-body-style="background-color:#fff;">
	<img src="https://media.brntn.me/postie/aa4b3202.png" />
</div>

---

<!-- body-class:alt -->

Identification and Authentication Failures

---

Allowing the wrong user (malicious or not) to authenticate to a system

---

Account enumeration, especially when weak and previously leaked passwords are allowed

---

Misconfiguration of authentication that allows MFA bypass, OAuth scope creep, unverified user registrations, etc..

---

<div>
	<img src="https://media.brntn.me/postie/c52fbfb0.png" />
</div>

---

<!-- body-class:alt -->

Software and Data Integrity Failures

---

Assuming that the build you just tested is the one that will be deployed

---

Using dependencies from third parties without verifying them

---

Allowing untrusted code into your ecosystem

---

<div data-body-style="background-color:#fff;">
	<img src="https://media.brntn.me/postie/0891c86a.png" />
</div>

---

<!-- body-class:alt -->

Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

---

Not having enough information to investigate an issue

---

Logging so much information that it becomes toxic waste

<!-- body-class:alt -->

Server-Side Request Forgery

---

Allowing your server to make requests to a resource provided by a user

---

Making requests that reveal metadata about the service

---

Tricking servers into mining cryptocurrencies

---

```bash
http://google.com:80+&@127.88.23.245:22/#+@google.com:80/
```

Wrap Up

---

The OWASP Top 10 is a great guide, but is really only the first 10 of 100s of potential issues

---

Think about security early, during the planning and design phase of new work
