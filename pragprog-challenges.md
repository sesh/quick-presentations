You are asked "which has the higher bandwidth: a 1 Gbps network connection, or a person walking between two computers with a full 1TB of storage device in their pocket?"<br><br><br>

What constraints will you put on your answer to ensure that the scope of your response is correct?

So, which has the higher bandwidth?

---

The storage device contains the information we need to be transferred

---

We know the speed at which the person walks

---

We know the distance between the machines

---

We are not accounting for the time it takes to transfer information to and from the storage device

---

The overhead of storing data is roughly equal to the overhead of sending it over a communication line

---

> Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway.
